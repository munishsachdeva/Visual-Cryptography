# Visual-Cryptography

This project aims to develop a secure e-voting system to create any-time anywhere voting possible. The concern of trust deficit of people in online voting is addressed by providing security and confidentiality through Steganography and Visual Cryptography. Voterâ€™s privacy and individual verifiability is at 
heart of our project.

Phishing is a technique used by an individual or a group to get personal information from unwitting victims. To do this, fake websites that look quite similar to the actual ones are hosted. Internet voting focuses on issues of security, privacy, and secrecy, as well as problems for stakeholder participation and process observation. To combat phishing attempts, a new voting system technique is offered.

Visual Cryptography (VC) voting system seeks to provide a tool for casting votes for sensitive and confidential internal corporate decisions. It has the capability of allowing voters to vote from anywhere in the world. The election is held in complete secrecy, with sufficient security mechanisms in place to allow voters to vote for any participating candidate According to this approach, user registration contains the captcha image and the image is splits into 
two parts using K-N sharing algorithm, XOR. For the purpose of user authentication user is sent one share (part of image) and other part of image is on server side. By combining these shares (share 1 and share 2) voters can vote their favourite candidate with Visual Cryptography
